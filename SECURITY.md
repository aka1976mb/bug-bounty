# Security Policy

The 0Din team takes security seriously. If you are a security researcher and believe you have found a security vulnerability in our systems, we encourage you to report it to us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report all vulnerabilities by creating an issue using our [Security Report Template](https://github.com/aka1976mb/bug-bounty/issues/new?template=security-report.md).

## Our Commitment

For a detailed overview of our security policies, including our Safe Harbor statement, scope, and what to expect after reporting a vulnerability, please see our full [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](VULNERABILITY_DISCLOSURE_POLICY.md).

Our primary security contact is `security@your-domain.com`, but we prefer that you use the issue template for initial reports.
