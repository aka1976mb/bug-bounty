# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)

## Introduction

The 0Din team is committed to ensuring the security of our AI/ML systems and services. We believe that a collaborative relationship with the security research community is essential to achieving this goal. This VDP outlines our policies for reporting and disclosing security vulnerabilities.

We encourage security researchers to report any potential vulnerabilities they may discover in our systems. We are committed to working with the community to verify, reproduce, and respond to legitimate reports.

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted under this policy to be authorized and will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith. We will work with researchers to understand and resolve issues quickly, and we will not engage in legal action for accidental, good-faith violations of this policy.

To be considered "in good faith," you must:

*   Not access, exfiltrate, or modify any user data.
*   Not perform any action that would disrupt our services.
*   Report the vulnerability exclusively to us, with no public disclosure until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.
*   Adhere to all other aspects of this policy.

## Scope

This policy applies to all systems and services owned and operated by the 0Din program, as detailed in our `SCOPE.md` document. Any systems not explicitly listed in `SCOPE.md` are out of scope.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

Please report all vulnerabilities using our [Security Report Template](https://github.com/aka1976mb/bug-bounty/issues/new?template=security-report.md).

When submitting a report, please include as much detail as possible, including:

*   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
*   Clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or videos that demonstrate the vulnerability.

## What to Expect After Reporting

After you submit a report, we will:

1.  **Triage:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 business days and begin our triage process.
2.  **Validation:** We will work to validate the vulnerability. We may contact you for additional information during this process.
3.  **Remediation:** If the vulnerability is validated, we will begin the remediation process.
4.  **Communication:** We will keep you informed of our progress and provide you with an estimated timeline for the fix.
5.  **Recognition:** Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will recognize your contribution (with your permission) and process any applicable bounties as described in `REWARDS.md`.

## Disclosure Policy

We believe in coordinated disclosure. We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it. We will work with you to agree on a mutually acceptable timeline for public disclosure.

## Rewards

Our reward structure is detailed in our `REWARDS.md` document.

Thank you for helping us keep our systems and our users safe.
